The bar will be perpendicular to the torso and the floor. This will be your starting position.","As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.","After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.","Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions."],"Category":"strength"},"83":{"Name":"Wide-Grip Decline Barbell Pullover","Force":"pull","Level":"intermediate","Mechanic":"compound","Equipment":"barbell","PrimaryMuscles":["chest"],"SecondaryMuscles":["shoulders","triceps"],"Instructions":["Lie down on a decline bench with both legs securely locked in position.
